**Deep Learning Model for Forecasting Customer Churn**

**Objective**

The objective of this project is to develop a deep learning model for accurately forecasting customer churn. This involves understanding why customers are leaving and building a model to predict churn based on various features.

**Problem Statement**

Issue: Predicting customer churn to understand why customers are discontinuing their association with a business.
Goal: Construct a deep learning model that can forecast customer churn with high accuracy.

**Dataset**

File: Churn.csv
Feature to Drop: customerID (This feature is dropped as it does not contribute to the prediction of churn.)

**Steps Performed**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering
3. Configuring the model
4. Activation Function
5. Validation Set
6. Epochs
7. Cross Entropy
8. Optimizer
9. One Hot Encoding (OHE)
10. Normalization
11. Train-test Split
12. Confusion Matrix
13. Prediction
14. Regularization

**Results**

Initial Model Performance: Accuracy: 80%, Precision: 77%, Recall: 73%
Model Performance After Reconfiguration 1: Accuracy: 82%, Precision: 79%, Recall: 75%
Model Performance After Reconfiguration 2: Accuracy: 85%, Precision: 81%, Recall: 78%

**Conclusion**

The deep learning model successfully forecasts customer churn with increasing accuracy through iterative reconfiguration.
The final model showed improved performance, achieving the highest accuracy and balanced precision and recall.
